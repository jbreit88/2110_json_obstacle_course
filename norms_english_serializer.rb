`say We build each other up. We are all in this together. Your win is my win.`
`say We help each other learn and respect that we all learn differently.`
`say We are people first.  We start our time together by remembering we are people, not just screens working on the same thing.`
`say We ask questions when we are confused or uncertain about our next steps. When possible, we post our questions in the public channel to maintain a record in case someone else has the same question later.`
`say We acknowledge, celebrate, and invite our individual experiences, differences, and backgrounds into every interaction.`
